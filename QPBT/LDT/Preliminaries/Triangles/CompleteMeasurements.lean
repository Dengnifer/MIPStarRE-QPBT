# Linear consistency triangles for complete measurements

This module proves a linear-error three-link triangle inequality for complete
measurements.  The proof combines the exact decomposition of consistency into
squared distance and projectivity defects with the existing three-step
state-dependent-distance triangle.

The completeness hypotheses are essential: the corresponding statement is
false for arbitrary submeasurements.

/-- Linear-error heterogeneous triangle for complete measurements.

If `A` is consistent with `B`, `C` is consistent with `B`, and `C` is
consistent with `D`, then `A` is consistent with `D` at three times the sum of
the input errors.  This alternative linear bound also requires completeness of
all four families. -/
